## 👨🏽‍💻 PY-NOOB
Python Beginner Guide : This repository has simple example programs that shows how python work. If you start from the first lesson, you could understand the basics of python programming without wasting time on long tutorials. You can run those scripts and change variables and functions (reverse engineer) to understand more.

Appreciate every single one who reported the issues and contributed ideas. These programs might look __"LESS PYTHONIC"__. Again these programs are a __FIRST STEP FOR NEWBIES__ who trying to understand what's going on in python. After you learn a thing or two by messing with these programs, you can be __"MORE PYTHONIC"__.
